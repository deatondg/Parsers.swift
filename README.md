# Parsers.swift: Ergonomic Combinatory Parsing

This library aims to provide enough primitive parsers, parser combinators, and `@resultBuilder`s to write clean and understandable parsers for most grammars.
Right now, it is a work-in-progress with just enough parsers to consume my upcoming template language, Lia. 
Eventually, a large portion of this code will be auto-generated by Lia.

A detailed readme will come soon.
